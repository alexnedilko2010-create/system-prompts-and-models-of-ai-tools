## üìà PROFITABILITY SCENARIOS

### **SCENARIO 1: Conservative Time Decay**
```
–ü–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã:
- Flash loan: $100,000 USDC
- LTV: 83% (–±–ª–∏–∑–∫–æ –∫ 85% liquidation threshold)
- Debt amount: $83,000
- Strategy: Wait for natural price movement
- Time: 2-24 hours

–†–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç—ã:
LiquidationBonus = $83,000 √ó 8% = $6,640
FlashFee = $100,000 √ó 0.0005 = $50
GasCosts = $25
ManipulationCosts = $0 (natural movement)
OpportunityCosts = $0

NetProfit = $6,640 - $50 - $25 - $0 = $6,565
ROI = $6,565 / $100,000 = 6.565%

Annualized ROI (–µ—Å–ª–∏ 1 —Ä–∞–∑ –≤ –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—é):
Weekly: 6.565% √ó 52 = 341% APY
```

### **SCENARIO 2: Debt Increase Strategy**
```
–ü–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã:
- Flash loan: $150,000 USDC
- Initial LTV: 75%
- Initial debt: $112,500
- Additional borrow: $15,000 (boost LTV to 85%)
- Final debt: $127,500

–†–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç—ã:
LiquidationBonus = $127,500 √ó 8% = $10,200
FlashFee = $150,000 √ó 0.0005 = $75
GasCosts = $30
ManipulationCosts = $0
InterestCosts = $127,500 √ó 0.001 = $127 (short-term interest)

NetProfit = $10,200 - $75 - $30 - $127 = $9,968
ROI = $9,968 / $150,000 = 6.645%

Time to execution: 400ms (–æ–¥–Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∑–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è)
```

### **SCENARIO 3: Price Manipulation Strategy**
```
–ü–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã:
- Flash loan: $200,000 USDC
- Position: $200k collateral, $160k debt (80% LTV)
- Price manipulation: 10% down
- New LTV after manipulation: 89%
- Liquidation bonus: 10%

–†–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç—ã:
LiquidationBonus = $160,000 √ó 10% = $16,000
FlashFee = $200,000 √ó 0.0005 = $100
GasCosts = $40
ManipulationCosts = $200,000 √ó 2% = $4,000 (price impact)
RecoveryCosts = $1,000 (restore price)

NetProfit = $16,000 - $100 - $40 - $4,000 - $1,000 = $10,860
ROI = $10,860 / $200,000 = 5.43%

Risk: High (market manipulation)
Legality: ‚ùå Illegal
```

### **SCENARIO 4: Flash Crash Strategy**
```
–ü–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä—ã:
- Flash loan: $500,000 USDC
- Position: $500k collateral, $400k debt (80% LTV)
- Flash crash: 25% temporary drop
- New LTV: 107% (highly liquidatable)
- Liquidation bonus: 15%

–†–∞—Å—á–µ—Ç—ã:
LiquidationBonus = $400,000 √ó 15% = $60,000
FlashFee = $500,000 √ó 0.0005 = $250
GasCosts = $50
CrashCosts = $500,000 √ó 3% = $15,000 (extreme manipulation)
RecoveryCosts = $2,000

NetProfit = $60,000 - $250 - $50 - $15,000 - $2,000 = $42,700
ROI = $42,700 / $500,000 = 8.54%

Risk: Extreme
Legality: ‚ùå Highly illegal
