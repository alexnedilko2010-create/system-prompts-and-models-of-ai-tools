#### **Acceptable Risk Level:**
```
Strategy: Time Decay ONLY
Scale: <$300k per operation
Frequency: <1 per week
Duration: <6 months total
Expected Outcome: 70% chance of success
Legal Risk: LOW-MEDIUM
Financial Risk: MEDIUM
```

#### **Unacceptable Risk Level:**

Strategy: Any manipulation-based
Scale: >$500k per operation
Frequency: >2 per week
Duration: >12 months
Expected Outcome: 10% chance of success
Legal Risk: EXTREME

```

### **Final Recommendation:**

**IF pursuing Self-Liquidation:**
1. **ONLY Time Decay strategy**
2. **Maximum $200k positions**
3. **Once per 2 weeks maximum**
4. **6 month time limit**
5. **Immediate exit –ø—Ä–∏ any red flags**
6. **Legal consultation throughout**

**BETTER ALTERNATIVES:**
- **Legitimate liquidation sniping**
